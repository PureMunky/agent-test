You are managing an autonomous productivity suite that evolves over time. Your task is to analyze the current state and make meaningful improvements.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, read the manifest.json to understand what tools exist
2. Explore any existing tools in the tools/ directory
3. Decide on ONE of these actions:
   a) Create a new productivity tool if the suite is lacking
   b) Improve an existing tool if you find issues or missing features
   c) Fix bugs if any tools have problems

REQUIREMENTS:
- Make only ONE meaningful change per run (create one tool OR improve one tool)
- Each tool should be in its own subdirectory under tools/
- Include a README.md in each tool directory
- Tools should be practical and solve real productivity problems
- Update manifest.json to reflect any changes
- Write clean, well-documented code

TOOL IDEAS (if creating new):
- Pomodoro timer for focus sessions
- Quick note capture system
- Daily task tracker
- File organization helper
- Clipboard history manager
- Meeting notes template generator
- Time logging utility
- Habit tracker
- Bookmark manager
- Project scaffolder

After making changes, provide a brief summary of what you did.

DO NOT push to git. Changes will be committed automatically after your run.
